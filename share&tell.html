			<div class="explanation">
				At the end of March, I was hired as a contract UIUX designer by a Cal alumnus who was creating an audio-based Q&A app. After podcasting about finance on iTunes, he found that uploading to iTunes was an arduous process, so he wanted to create an easy way to post audio on a platform that could educate people about finance, hence his product Share & Tell.

			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 The co-founders believed audio to be underrated, considering currently emerging technologies go beyond audio. However, they believe that audio is the "most natural form of communication," so they sought to create this app in hopes of creating a space where people can answer questions through spoken communication.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Written communication can lack the mood and feelings attached to oral communication, which can change the way one understands a message. For example, sarcasm can be difficult to detect through text. </p>
				<p>&#8226 Financial literacy is an important skill, yet American schools and universities often do not require these skills to be taught.</p>

			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 When a question is asked, the user can simply record themselves verbally answering the question and submit it when they are satisfied.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 By answering questions verbally, listeners can pick up on meaningful linguistic cues, such as pauses, hesitation, and tone.</p>
				<p>&#8226 When asking a question, the user can send it to specific people so that they can learn from people who have expertise in that area. </p>

	        	<a href="assets/img/share&tell-flow1.png" data-lightbox="Box_2" data-title="Login // Feed // Playback // Playback Option // Categories">
	            <img class="ux-2" src="assets/img/share&tell-flow1.png">
	        	</a>
    		</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 On the feed screen, it shows the most recent questions asked by people the user follows. The user can click on the question to view the answers to the question. </p>
				<p>&#8226 On the playback screen, it shows the question again, and also shows the people who have answered the question. By pressing on the person, it will prompt their audio on the bottom of the screen. In this case, Eric Tang's response was pressed, so his answer is the one that will play. Users can press the next or back buttons to listen to other people's answers, or they can click on the person's name. </p>
				<p>&#8226 By clicking on the more options icon on the playback screen, it opens a pop up window that gives the options to view the profile, follow the user, or cancel. </p>
				<p>&#8226 Back on the feed screen, users can press categories to lead to the categories screen. Currently the only categories planned for are finance, technology, and uncategorized, but the co-founders are hoping to expand this list. </p>

			<div class="heading-share">Interaction Flow &mdash; Asking a Question</div>
			<div class="example">
	        	<a href="assets/img/share&tell-flow2.png" data-lightbox="Box_3" data-title="Ask a Question // Who to Ask // Search // Profile // Record">
	            <img class="ux-2" src="assets/img/share&tell-flow2.png">
	        	</a>
    		</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 After pressing the ? icon, users can view questions that they have been asked, and they can also ask their own questions. First, the user types out the question, adding hashtags to add specific categories. They then choose a general category from uncategorized, finance, or technology.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 After pressing "Next," the user then chooses from their followers who they would like to ask the qustion to. Once they press "Ask," it will be sent to those users. </p>
				<p>&#8226 By clicking on the search icon, it leads to the search screen. On the search screen, users can type in a name and users with that name will pop up. Users can click on their name or picture to go to their profile.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 The profile screen, inspired by Instagram, shows the number of questions answered and the number of followers / following. It also shows the questions asked, answered, and favorited. Users can also press the follow button or the unfollow button if they are already following them.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Once a question is asked to the user, the user can then answer the question by recording their response. The user can press record, stop, think about the rest of their response if needed, and record more. Once the answer has been completed, they can press "Done," which will post their answer to on the playback screen.</p>

				<p>&#8226 This app creates a platform where people can easily ask questions and easily record answers to questions.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Audio answers allow for a different way of learning from typical text-based learning.</p>
				<p>&#8226 People can create networks and share knowledge, allowing users to educate others and also learn from others. </p>

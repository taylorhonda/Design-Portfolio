				I currently work for Cal Dining as a cashier, and I have also worked as a food service worker for them in the past. Being a full-time student, sometimes certain events come up that conflict with my work schedule, so I need to find a sub for work. However, that process can be quite difficult and stressful. In this personal project, I designed an application that makes it much easier to find a sub for work.

				<p>&#8226 Cal Dining requires us to request for a sub at least two weeks in advance of our scheduled shift. However, knowing one's plans two weeks in advance can be difficult if one does not regularly update a calendar.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Workers currently find subs through word-of-mouth, Facebook chat, an unofficial Facebook group, a physical sub book, but most widely through mass email. The email process means that workers are bombarded with emails and reply alls on a daily basis, which can be troublesome.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Because of the flood of emails, many students may not even check their emails if they know it is a request for a sub. Therefore, the email process is counterintuitive to its goal.</p>

				<p>&#8226 The main feature of the app is a calendar. With the calendar, it helps users visualize and plan ahead in order to meet the two week policy.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 The calendar allows one to view when others have requested a sub, and it allows one to take on someone's shift or part of their shift. One can also message the person through the app to ask any questions about the shift. </p>
				<p>&#8226 Users may also adjust what requests they see by filtering out when, where and what they cannot or do not want to sub for other people. For example, a worker at Bear Market may not want to receive sub requests for Foothill, which is quite far. A worker may also not want to receive requests for certain times on certain days because they may conflict with their schedule. A regular food service worker is also not eligible to sub for a cashier or a lead, so workers can adjust their calendars based on their role. </p>

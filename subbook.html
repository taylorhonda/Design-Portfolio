				Previously, I worked at Cal Dining as a cashier and food service worker. Having been a full-time student, sometimes certain events came up that conflicted with my work schedule, so I needed to find a sub for work. However, that process was often quite difficult and stressful. In this personal project, I designed an application that simplifies the process of finding a sub for work.
			</div>
			<div class="example">
	        	<a href="assets/img/subbook.png" data-lightbox="Box_1" data-title="Subbook">
	            <img class="ux-2" src="assets/img/subbook.png">
	        	</a>
    		</div>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<div class="heading-subbook">Problems</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 Cal Dining requires workers to request a sub at least two weeks in advance of our scheduled shift. However, knowing one's plans two weeks in advance can be difficult if one does not regularly update a calendar.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Workers currently find subs through word-of-mouth, Facebook chat, an unofficial Facebook group, a physical sub book, but most widely through mass email. The email process means that workers are bombarded with emails and reply-alls on a daily basis, which can be overwhelming.</p>
				<p>&#8226 Because of the flood of emails, many students may not even check their emails if they know it is a request for a sub. Therefore, the email process is counterintuitive to its goal.</p>

			<div class="heading-subbook">Solutions</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 The main feature of the app is a calendar. With the calendar, it helps users visualize and plan ahead in order to meet the two week policy.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 The calendar allows one to view when others have requested a sub, and it allows one to take on someone's shift or part of their shift. One can also message the person through the app to ask any questions about the shift. </p>
				<p>&#8226 Users may also adjust what requests they see by filtering out when, where and what they cannot or do not want to sub for other people. For example, a worker at Bear Market may not want to receive sub requests for Foothill, which is quite far. A worker may also not want to receive requests for certain times on certain days because they may conflict with their schedule. A regular food service worker is also not eligible to sub for a cashier or a lead, so workers can adjust their calendars based on their role. </p>

			<div class="example">
	        	<a href="assets/img/subbook-flow1.png" data-lightbox="Box_2" data-title="Calendar // Profile // Accept Options // Partial Accept // Coverage Confirmation">
	            <img class="ux-2" src="assets/img/subbook-flow1.png">
	        	</a>
    		</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 On the calendar screen, users can view different dates and times where others have requested a shift cover, indicated by a colored dot underneath the date. On the screen shown, the user has pressed on March 20, so the two sub requests for that day are shown. The user can then press on one of the two requests to move to the profile screen.   </p>
				<p>&#8226 Once on the profile screen, users can view the requested shift again, as well as the optional message attached that explains why they need a shift cover. From there, the user can message the person, view their full profile, or proceed and accept to cover the shift. </p>
				<p>&#8226 It is common for people to cover only part of someone's shift, so I included two options: to accept the whole shift or part of the shift. If the user presses "Accept partial," it will lead to the partial accept screen, where one can indicate what hours of the shift they would like to cover.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 Once they click accept, it will show a confirmation screen. Looking back at the accept options page, if the user presses "Accept whole," it will lead directly to the confirmation page.  </p>

			<div class="heading-subbook">Interaction Flow &mdash; Requesting a Sub</div>
			<div class="example">
	        	<a href="assets/img/subbook-flow2.png" data-lightbox="Box_3" data-title="Calendar // Notifications // Shift Options // Description // Confirmation">
	            <img class="ux-2" src="assets/img/subbook-flow2.png">
	        	</a>
    		</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 Starting with the calendar view again, one can click on the red circled number to show their notifications. In this case, the user has two notifications, so it shows a circled 2. Once the notifications are opened, it shows things, such as requests to take their shift, in which the user can accept or decline. One may want to decline someone from taking their shift if they feel they are unreliable or if they are only accepting a partial amount that is inconvenient. Other notifications include messages from people and confirmations that one has accepted their request to take their shift.  </p>
				<p>&#8226 One can press on the circled + on the top right corner to add their own request to the calendar, in this case, on March 20, since that is the day selected. Once pressed, it leads the user to the shift options screen, where the user can indicate the time of their shift, where the shift is, and what their role is. For the time, users can click on the - or + depending on if they want to indicate an earlier or later time. The user can also click on the time, which will prompt their number keyboard to show, so that they can simply type in their shift, rather than having to use the buttons. The location and role can be indicated through a simple drop-down menu. </p>
				<p>&#8226 The user may press "Add description" in order to add a message describing why they cannot make their shift. Sometimes adding a message can garner sympathy, which helps in getting their shift covered. On the message screen, they simply type into the box and press "submit" when they're finished. This will lead them to the confirmation screen. Users can also skip the description screen and click submit from the shift options screen to directly lead to the confirmation screen. </p>

			<div class="heading-subbook">Takeaways</div>
			<div class="explanation">
				<p>&#8226 Rather than going through the troublesome process of finding a sub through mass email, Facebook groups, and Messenger, users can simply use this calendar-based app to find subs.</p>
				<p>&#8226 The app is very specific to Cal Dining procedures; however, the overall idea can be adapted for finding substitutes for work that many food service workers could use. </p>
				<p>&#8226 The calendar also organizes all the requests in a centralized place, which makes finding a sub and subbing for someone else a much simpler process. </p>
